# CBS Introduction to Programming and Application Design (C#)

###### This is the first mandatory assignment of the course.

Three reflection points about the assignment:

- As I have prior coding experience I decided to stick with Visual Studio Code. Consequently I had to learn how to use .NET with VS Code, where project creation is done through console (e.g.: dotnet new console) instead of at the click of a button like in VS. Also debugging and the installation of C# plugin differs.
- As a Javascript programmer memory allocation and type declaration of variables were new concepts to me, as there is no type declaration necessary in javascript and type coercion would be done automatically.
- I had no problems with the understanding of the common programming concepts whatsoever.
